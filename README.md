# stream-archiver

This is a Docker container that auto-archives live streams from **Twitch** and **Kick**.

For Twitch streams, it uses an OAuth token to avoid ads on subscribed channels.
For Kick streams, it uses streamlink with a custom plugin to monitor and download streams.

I set this up to download streams to a folder served by Plex.

## Usage

### Quick Start

Twitch only:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v ./output:/output \
  -e TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id \
  -e TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret \
  -e TWITCH_OAUTH_TOKEN=oauth:your_token_here \
  -e TWITCH_CHANNELS=paymoneywubby \
  avalonlee/stream-archiver:latest
```

Kick only:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v ./output:/output \
  -e KICK_CHANNELS=paymoneywubby \
  avalonlee/stream-archiver:latest
```

Both:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v ./output:/output \
  -e TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id \
  -e TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret \
  -e TWITCH_OAUTH_TOKEN=oauth:your_token_here \
  -e TWITCH_CHANNELS=paymoneywubby \
  -e KICK_CHANNELS=paymoneywubby \
  avalonlee/stream-archiver:latest
```

### Using Docker Compose

1. Create a docker-compose.yaml

```yaml
services:
  stream-archiver:
    image: avalonlee/stream-archiver:latest
    environment:
      # === TWITCH CONFIGURATION  ===
      # Get from Twitch Developer Console: https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps
      # Hint: use "https://localhost" as the redirect URL for your app.
      - TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
      - TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
      # Get OAuth token from: https://twitchapps.com/tmi/
      - TWITCH_OAUTH_TOKEN=oauth:your_token_here
      # Comma-separated list of Twitch channels to monitor
      - TWITCH_CHANNELS=paymoneywubby
      
      # === KICK CONFIGURATION ===
      # Comma-separated list of Kick channels to monitor
      - KICK_CHANNELS=paymoneywubby
      
      # === GENERAL SETTINGS ===
      # How often to check if streams are live (in seconds)
      - CHECK_INTERVAL=30
      # Your timezone, e.g., America/New_York, Europe/London, etc.
      - TZ=America/Los_Angeles
    volumes:
      # Where to store the downloaded videos
      - ./output:/output
    restart: unless-stopped
```

1. Run the container

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Platform Support

### Twitch üéÆ
- **Requirements**: Client ID, Client Secret, and OAuth Token
- **Features**: Ad-free recording for subscribed channels
- **Setup**: Get credentials from [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps) and OAuth token from [twitchapps.com](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/)

### Kick ‚ö°
- **Requirements**: Just channel names (no authentication needed)  
- **Features**: Direct stream recording using custom streamlink plugin
- **Setup**: Simply add channel names to `KICK_CHANNELS`

You can configure **both platforms simultaneously** or use just one - the archiver will automatically detect which platforms are configured and monitor accordingly.

The stream shows up on my Plex server for immediate playback while the stream downloads.
